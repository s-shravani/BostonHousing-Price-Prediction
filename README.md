Boston House Price Predictions

This repository contains code for predicting house prices in Boston using various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree. The goal of this project is to build models that can accurately predict house prices based on different features of the houses.

A] Dataset

The dataset used for this prediction task is the famous 'Boston Housing Dataset'. It is included in the repository itself for easy access. 


B] Machine Learning Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms have been employed for the house price prediction task:

1. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

2. Linear Regression: A simple linear model that establishes a relationship between the input features and the target variable.

3. Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space. In this case, it's used for regression to predict house prices.

4. Decision Tree: A non-linear model that partitions the feature space into regions and predicts the target variable based on the average target values in each region.
